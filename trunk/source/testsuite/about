Inside here will be source code that will be used to test the capabilities of the submission system. 

What we need:
For each language, we need a piece of code that tries to:
- execute a random command from the system
- create, delete, move files around
- fork or create new processes
- use the internet/open sockets
- runs and doesn't output anything
- hangs idle
- crashes or throw an exception

And then we need to create a 'queue' file that contains all these 
files and tells the poll'er to run it.
