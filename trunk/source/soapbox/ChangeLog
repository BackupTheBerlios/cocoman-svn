v0.3.1
 - Release shipped the actual binaries (Denis Morel)

v0.3.0
 - Improved dirname() to be string-safe
 - Added str_cut(), to copy and cut a string before referencing
 - Replaced str_cut() by strndup()
 - Implemented __xmknod() libc function (used by mknod command)
 - Implemented utimes() libc function (exported but never encountered)
 - Added sb_log for debugging and log purposes
 - Don't unsetenv() environment variables (daisy-chaining soapboxes should be possible)
 - Makefile now contains version info and converts soapbox.sh and soapbox.spec
 - Make soapbox.sh display version
 - Implemented lchown() libc function
 - Implemented remove() libc function
 - Fixed static vars and functions (Koblinger Egmont)

v0.2.1
 - Make open() and open64() print out correct flags when O_CREAT is disabled
 - Another audit of the code by Peter Leurs and some suggestions (ie. use snprintf)
 - When allocating strings, tail it with a \0 for that feeling of safety
 - Global variables are now defined static
 - Improved sb_die so it handles multiple arguments, eg. sb_die(stderr, "%s: %s", fn, err)
 - Added some checks for return codes

v0.2.0
 - Created sb_die so code is cleaner
 - Moved the glibc function-definitions to top of code (ouside each function)
 - Moved the dlsym-calls to _init() (outside each function)
 - Fixed a possible segfault in the action-handling
   (we were using a 'known' symbolname 'err', now using enum)
 - Make it build on older gcc (< 3.0) versions

v0.1.2
 - Yet another fix to rewrite() for R_LINK
 - A fix for non-existing files
 - Display permissions with file-type info
 - Added more debugging output (real invocations are printed too)
 - I might have to rethink the debugging priority,
   because now it defaults rapidly to too much info

v0.1.1
 - Fixed a leftover free() in rewrite()
 - Cleaned up 'Symbols not found error'
 - Fixed chmod() still using rpath
 - open() and open64() now removing the O_CREAT from flags when opening O_RDONLY

v0.1.0
 - Added -- option to force start of command
 - More fixes to rename() and rmdir() wrt symlinks
 - Changed order of rewrite() and debug in each overloaded function
 - Implemented mkfifo() libc function
 - Audit of the code by Christophe Devriese
 - Christophe Devriese found some possible buffer overflows
 - Christophe Devriese fixed a bug in has_access()

v0.0.12
 - Implemented creat() and creat64() libc functions
 - Fixed remaining problems with argument list of open() and open64()
 - Added str_flags() for conversion van open() flags to strings
 - Added '|' delimiter for open() flags
 - Cleaned up rewrite() function and added debug8 information about filetypes
 - Added -c option to soapbox script, to add current working directory
 - Changed debugging priority a bit (could be changed in the future once more)
    -d 8 will print file-type info
    -d 16 will print general debug info
 - Made -d option bitwise (from 0 until 31)

v0.0.11
 - Debug output clean-ups (file permissions or %04o now)
 - Spaces between arguments in debug-output
 - SOAPBOXPATH fixes in soapbox script (cannot be polluted)
 - Let soapbox script detect when no command argument is given
 - Added symlink-detection and dirname() to rewrite()
 - Fixed unlink() and symlink() for symbolic links

v0.0.10
 - Fixed the access to /dev/null as O_RDRW instead of O_RDONLY
 - Made -d option bitwise (from 0 until 15)
 - Added -s option to soapbox script, to add a bunch of 'safe' paths
 - Added ',' and ';' as a path delimiter
 - Fixed a fprintf that should have been strcat in debug-output for open()

v0.0.9
 - Uncommented a commented fprintf debug message for mkdir()
 - Added SOAPBOXDEBUG for runtime debugging
 - Removed -DDEBUG option
 - Added '-d' switch for the soapbox script
    -d 1 will print command + args
    -d 2 will print libc functions
    -d 4 will print internal functions
    -d 8 will print general debug info
 - Numbered the different debug-messages

v0.0.8
 - Added SOAPBOXLOG for logging to an external file instead of stderr.
 - Action halt now really halts the process successfully.
 - Cleaned up the test-suite (make test)
 - Added shellscript and configfile for easy testing

v0.0.7
 - Reimplemented rewrite()
 - Rewrite path happens in the overloaded libc function and keep original
 - Rewrite path as a seperate function rewrite()

v0.0.6
 - Added debugging flag, use -DDEBUG
 - Implemented overloading using dlopen() and dlsym()
