(New) Things we want from cocoman:
- personal scoreboard
- single python app
- submission management from a frontend (regrading, and such)
- automatic submission with optional recommendation mode.

--

User Class:
Id
Name
Submissions []
solved_problems() - a function that goes through submissions and returns a list of all solved problems.

Submission Class:
time
filename
userid
problem number

Sample flow:

handler.queue_submission(user_id, file_contents, file_name, problem_number)
new Submission()
user.add_submission(submission)
subumission_processor.add_submission(submission)
handle.ok_response()

--

add_submission(submission) (in submission_processor
add submission to queue

-- 
submission process, main()
    while True
        get submission from queue
        log
        build
        run tests
        set submission status
        lookup user and rebuild scoreboard
        webserver.rebuild_scoreboard()


--

Look of the personal scoreboard:

(Solved)   Problem1    [3] [12:30]
(Unsolved) Problem2    [1] [12:35]
(Solved)   Problem3    [1] [12:15]

Pending:
[Problem2 submitted at 12:37]
[Problem2 submitted at 12:40]
