Soapbox TODO items


 + Soapbox could check for SOAPBOXACTION
    - if it contains "redir=/new/path", redirect writes/changes to /new/path
    - probably something for a new project that extends soapbox (the way we know it)


 + A manpage


 + Use ptrace to actually trap system calls, check if they may be executed,
   and log the action (if not allowed).

   treesbox is the test implementation, that is no longer required to be a library.


Also see BUGS ;-)
