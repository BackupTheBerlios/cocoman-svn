HOW DOES IT WORK

See the homepage for some more information:

	http://dag.wieers.com/home-made/soapbox/


EXAMPLES

	I made some examples to demonstrate the use, you can (safely) run this:

		### Run successful
		make SOAPBOXPATH="/var/tmp" test

		### Halt on the first attempt
		make SOAPBOXACTION="halt" test

		### Return error, and notify user
		make SOAPBOXACTION="err" test

		### Return warning, fake succesful run and notify user
		make SOAPBOXACTION="warn" test


ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES

	LD_PRELOAD

	SOAPBOXPATH
	SOAPBOXLOG
	SOAPBOXACTION
	SOAPBOXDEBUG

//	SOAPBOXCONF
