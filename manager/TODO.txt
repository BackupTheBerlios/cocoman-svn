To Do
-----
o Have submission system give the timestamp of the most recently processed submission.
o Registration page.
o Show time left in contest.
o New directory layout- largly done but I think could still be improved a little
o Security
o More robust ids
o Change handles filename to users
o Put build directions in info file?
o See if it's possible to do something so that users don't hit the case where the scoreboard refreshes while they're browsing for a file and when they select it it doesn't go in the box. (Is this browser specific?)
