To Do
-----
o Have submission system give the timestamp of the most recently processed submission.
o New directory layout- largly done but I think could still be improved a little
o Security
o More robust ids
o See if it's possible to do something so that users don't hit the case where the scoreboard refreshes while they're browsing for a file and when they select it it doesn't go in the box. (Is this browser specific?)
o Find safer way for submit-registration.php to be able to write to users file - have users file owned by apache account?
o Remove the construction of the .make files from the php scripts. I think the shell scripts are better suited to be customized to a machine's setup or to try to figure out how to build stuff.
o Don't allow submissions when contest isn't going on.
o Countdown till start time.
o Submission dialog automatically picks the problem you last submiteed.
