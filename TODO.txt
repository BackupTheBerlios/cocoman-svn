To Do
-----
* See if it's possible to do something so that users don't hit the case where the scoreboard refreshes while they're browsing for a file and when they select it it doesn't go in the box. (Is this browser specific?) // In response: perhaps a framed page is the way to fix it. I.E. frame the scoreboard and have it autorefresh, but do not have the submit part inside that frame.
* Submission dialog automatically picks the problem you last submiteed
* Have more important output go to logs/manager.log (compiles, program runs, etc)
* Rewrite the css and make the UI more friendly for use.
* Implement C# support php script side and test it out manager side.
* Test that programs are properly soapboxed (needs alot of testing)
* Have submit script write line in queue file instead of web server.
* Create test suite for contest manager
* Make sure clean() in manager still works with new directories
* Implement better system for web scripts being able to log things.
* Make everything more robust when various configuration files/options are missing.
* Get normal diff working correctly instead of needing our own custom one.
