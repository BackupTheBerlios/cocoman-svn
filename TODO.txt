To Do
-----
o New directory layout- largly done but I think could still be improved a little
o See if it's possible to do something so that users don't hit the case where the scoreboard refreshes while they're browsing for a file and when they select it it doesn't go in the box. (Is this browser specific?)
o Find safer way for submit-registration.php to be able to write to users file - have users file owned by apache account?
o Don't allow submissions when contest isn't going on.
o Countdown till start time
o Submission dialog automatically picks the problem you last submiteed
o Have more important output go to logs/manager.log (compiles, program runs, etc)

Done
----
o Remove the construction of the .make files from the php scripts. I think the shell scripts are better suited to be customized to a machine's setup or to try to figure out how to build stuff. // Done, check 'build' script inside manager/manager
o Security - when running applications, executor now gives very little permissions to java files and soapbox will be responsible for watching c/cpp system calls. // implemented in executor.c by Drew.
o More robust ids // implemented in genid in manager/ and setup for use.
o Have submission system give the timestamp of the most recently processed submission.
o Check for sane names
